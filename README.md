I left this project because it is very expensive. For me these were the numbers:
 - PCB for JLCPCB would have cost around 52 USD
 - Plus all the components (not including the keys) around 170 USD
 - The keys are not that expensive you can get MX compatible keys from Keychron from 16 USD or buy the original Cherry MX for 40 USD
 - Other than these you would need to buy the keycaps which would cost you around 80 USD for a set for a 106 key keyboard
 - Also you need a case and a plate which are custom made. For the plate I got an offer for 30 USD but with the shipping and tax it would have been 60 USD.

To sum everything up I think it would have cost me around 300-400 USD for one keyboard and 4 extra PCBs. Honestly it didn't worth it for me since I could buy a 
Keychron Q6 for 220 USD and a K10 Pro for 120 USD and those are better options because they have warranty.
